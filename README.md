I open the index.html file witk Google Chrome and Firefox Mozilla. I saw below differences.

General
 - Size of input fields
 - fonts of input fields

Behavior of the Number, color and date input is different from each other. For example in number i can see up and down arrow in Firefox. But in Chrome I could see that when i focus on that input field.
